Description:  This app is for personal trainers
to keep track of clients' sessions and for clients to
keep track of their own progress

Problem:  Most trainers keep clients' data on their phone which is often inaccurate or neglect to update.  Both trainer and their clients maintain clients' body stats in centralized location accessible by multi-platforms.
